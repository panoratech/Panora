## Introduction

### Setup your environnement

We made a docker file that builds Panora from sources, specifically to help you locally test your contributions. Here's how to use it.

<Info>Execute these from your Panora's repo root folder</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy env variables">
    ```bash 
    cp .env.example .env 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rules for env variables"> 
    <Info>
      You must manually create a custom OAuth2 App inside the 3rd party and copy the
      critical values (likely _client id and client secret_)
    </Info>
    You have the option to manage a custom 3rd party OAuth App.

    **Each custom 3rd party environment variable must be of the form `PROVIDER_category_SOFTWAREMODE_ATTRIBUTE` where**

    - `PROVIDER` is any 3rd party name
    - `category` is for example [CRM, TICKETING, MARKETINGAUTOMATION, ...]
    - `SOFTWAREMODE` is [ CLOUD, ONPREMISE ]
    - `ATTRIBUTE` is for example [ CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, SUBDOMAIN, ... ]

    _Example_ :

    - `HUBSPOT_CRM_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID = client_id_value_pasted_from_hubspot_developer_app`
    - `HUBSPOT_CRM_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET = client_secret_value_pasted_from_hubspot_developer_app`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Removed previously installed dependencies">
    ```bash 
    rm -rf node_modules .pnpm-store ./packages/api/dist ./packages/api/node_modules ./apps/webapp/node_modules ./apps/frontend_snippet/node_modules 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mac Users only:">
    ```bash 
    echo -e "node-linker=hoisted\n package-import-method=clone-or-copy" > .npmrc 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Dockerfile">
    ```bash 
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
    ``` 
  </Step>
</Steps>
  That's all ! You can find the backend and other services running at their usual location. Editing code locally will **immediately** reflect.

## Adding new Integrations ✨

Make sure you are inside `packages/api/src` where the server lives !

### You want to add a new 3rd Party not yet supported ? 🧑‍🎤

_Ie: Slack, Hubspot, Jira, Shopify ..._

First choose wisely which category the 3rd party belongs to among these:

- `crm`
- `ticketing`
- `accounting`
- `ats`
- `filestorage`
- `hris`
- `marketingautomation`

You can find all categories inside [`packages/shared/src/categories.ts`](https://github.com/panoratech/Panora/blob/main/packages/shared/src/categories.ts).

<Info>
  For the sake of the guide, now on we'll consider adding a 3rd party belonging
  to the `crm` category.
</Info>

# Step 1: Ensure 3rd party metadata is set

Look into the `packages/shared/src/connectors/metadata.ts` file and check if the provider you want to build has its metadata set inside the `CONNECTORS_METADATA` object.

It should be available (if not [contact us](https://app.cal.com/rflih/30)) with `active` field set to `false` meaning the integration has not been built.

Actually an integration is built in 2 parts :

- the **authentication part** (oauth, api key, basic etc) which is built by the Panora team
- the **service integration** where the mapping with our unified model is created whixch is what you'll build in the next steps

# Step 2: Build your provider service

### You want to map a common object to your new 3rd Party ? 👩‍🎤

_Ie: Contact, Ticket, Deal, Company ..._

For the sake of this guide, let's map the common object `contact` under `crm` category to _my3rdParty_ (in reality it would be a real 3rd party name).

<Info>
  **An integration is considered valid when all common objects have been mapped.
  Then, after the PR is accepted we'll be able to set `active` field to `true`
  inside `CONNECTORS_METADATA`**
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new service to map your common object to your 3rd party">
    Create a new service folder with the name of your 3rd party. Let's call it _my3rdParty_.

    ```bash
    cd crm/contact/services/my3rdParty
    ```

    You'll now create 3 files :

    - `index.ts` where your service is created and direct interaction with your 3rd party API is handled
    - `types.ts` where the 3rd party specific API types are defined
    - `mappers.ts` where the mapping between our unified common model and the 3rd party one is handled

    <Info>After copying the following code you'll end up with linting/deps errors. It is fixed by our script at Step 2.</Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create the index.ts file">
          It must implement the `IContactService` interface.
          ```ts
          export interface IContactService {
            addContact(
              contactData: DesunifyReturnType,
              linkedUserId: string
            ): Promise<ApiResponse<OriginalContactOutput>>;

            syncContacts(
              linkedUserId: string
            ): Promise<ApiResponse<OriginalContactOutput[]>>;
          }
          ```

          ```ts
          @Injectable()
          export class My3rdPartyService implements IContactService {
            constructor(
              private prisma: PrismaService,
              private logger: LoggerService,
              private cryptoService: EncryptionService,
              private registry: ServiceRegistry,
            ) {
              this.logger.setContext(
                CrmObject.contact.toUpperCase() + ':' + My3rdPartyService.name,
              );
              this.registry.registerService('my3rdParty', this);
            }
            async addContact(
              contactData: 3rdPartyContactInput,
              linkedUserId: string,
            ): Promise<ApiResponse<3rdPartyContactOutput>> {}

            async syncContacts(
              linkedUserId: string,
            ): Promise<ApiResponse<3rdPartyContactOutput[]>> {}
          }
          ```
          Check other implementations under `/crm/contacts/services` to fill the core functions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the types.ts file">
        The keen readers may have noticed `3rdPartyContactInput` and `3rdPartyContactOutput`.
        This is where `types.ts` comes in: <br/>
        Go to the 3rd party API and insert the correct types asked by the API.
        ```ts
        export interface 3rdPartyContact {
          //INSERT THE CORRECT TYPE HERE
        }
        export type 3rdPartyContactInput = Partial<3rdPartyContact>;
        export type 3rdPartyContactOutput = 3rdPartyContactInput;
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the mappers.ts file">
        Last but not least, inside `mappers.ts` you have to build the mappings between our unified common object `contact` and your third party specific type `3rdPartyContact`.

        It must implement `IContactMapper` interface.

        ```ts
        export interface IContactMapper {
          desunify(
            source: UnifiedContactInput,
            customFieldMappings?: {
              slug: string;
              remote_id: string;
            }[]
          ): DesunifyReturnType;

          unify(
            source: OriginalContactOutput | OriginalContactOutput[],
            customFieldMappings?: {
              slug: string;
              remote_id: string;
            }[]
          ): UnifiedContactOutput | UnifiedContactOutput[];
        }
        ```

        ```ts
        export class My3rdPartyMapper implements IContactMapper {
          desunify(
            source: UnifiedContactInput,
            customFieldMappings?: {
              slug: string;
              remote_id: string;
            }[],
          ): 3rdPartyContactInput {}

          unify(
            source: 3rdPartyContactOutput | 3rdPartyContactOutput[],
            customFieldMappings?: {
              slug: string;
              remote_id: string;
            }[],
          ): UnifiedContactOutput | UnifiedContactOutput[] {}
        }
        ```

        Check other implementations under `/crm/contacts/services` to fill the core functions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable your new service">
    After these 3 files are successfully created and filled, you are ready to fix all dependencies/linting issues that you may have. <br/>
    To make sure the service is enabled, dependencies and imports must be added. <br/>
    We built a script that does it in seconds. You can run the given Docker commands from the root directory of Panora.

    ```bash
      docker build -t validate_connectors -f ./packages/api/Dockerfile.validate-connectors .
    ```
    ```bash
      docker run -v $(pwd):/app/ -e VERTICAL=crm -e OBJECT_TYPE=contact validate_connectors
    ```    

    The script will automatically scan the `/crm/contact/services` folder and detect any new service folder so all dependencies and imports are updated across the codebase.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Congrats, you now have built a new integration with Panora ! 🦸‍♀️

  Nb: The development kit to add integrations out of the blue is coming soon 🎸
