# Test your new connector

Now you must test Panora unified endpoints with the new connector built.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a connection using the magic link">
         You need a set of credentials that you'll set in `.env` if you use oAuth (check [here](/open-source/self_hosting/envVariables#providers-specific-credentials) how it works). 
          Check [this guide](/core-concepts/magic-links) to create a connection through it.
          To activate your new connector on the magic link, visit this [**file**](https://github.com/panoratech/Panora/blob/main/packages/shared/src/connectors/metadata.ts#L6) :
          and change your connector status to `active: true`. 
      </Step>
      <Step title="Test with unified endpoints">
        Now after successfully creating a new connection, you can copy a `connection token` inside the webapp under `http://localhost/connections`.
        Create a Panora Api Key and make unified request with your `connection token`. 
        Check [this guide](/core-concepts/auth) to do it !
      </Step> 
    </Steps>
