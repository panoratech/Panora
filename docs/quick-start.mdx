## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A cloud [account](https://tally.so/r/w5ZoaN?source=docs_welcome) (or see our guide [here](/open-source/self-host-guide) on getting started with the selfhost version)
- An API key, see our guide [here](/core-concepts/auth)
- Node JS v18.17.1 or newer installed on your computer

## **Step 1: Get access to your users data**

You either have the option to use a [**no-code magic link**](/core-concepts/magic-links) or the [**embedded frontend snippet**](/recipes/embed-catalog) to get access to your user's data.
Choose the one that fits your needs !

[We recommend listening to webhooks to get notified once a user connects and catch the connection token used for requests.
](/recipes/catch-connection-token)

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="No Code: Magic links">
    Let's send our first magic link so you can ask your customers to grant you access to their tools, without writing code.
    <Frame type="glass">
      <video
        controls
        className="block"
        src="/images/magiclinkquickstart.mp4"
        alt="Hero Light"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Steps>
      <Step>Login to your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.panora.dev)</Step>
      <Step>
        Go to _Connections_ [section](https://dashboard.panora.dev/connections) and click button `Create a Magic Link`
      </Step>
      <Step>Click `Create a Unique Magic Link`</Step>
      <Step>
        You'll be asked for two informations: an `Origin User Email` (of the user
        you're creating the link for) and an `Origin User Identifier`. The `Origin
        User Identifier` is the id of the user you're inviting, as represented in your
        sofwtare. If you already have created a [Linked User](/recipes/import-existing-users) you have the option to select
        it.
      </Step>
      <Step>Click `Generate`</Step>
    </Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="For Developers: Native Integration">
    Embed Panora into your product with our native component to collect access to use user's data.
    <Info>
      You can find the component on NPM
      [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panora/embedded-card-react)
    </Info>
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Install the package in your code:">
            <CodeGroup>
                ```shell React
                npm i @panora/embedded-card-react
                ```
            </CodeGroup>
        </Step>

        <Step title="Import the component and the styles in your integrations page:">
            <CodeGroup>
                ```javascript React
                import "@panora/embedded-card-react/dist/index.css";
                import PanoraProviderCard from "@panora/embedded-card-react";
                import PanoraDynamicCatalog from "@panora/embedded-card-react";
                ```
            </CodeGroup>
        </Step>

        <Step title="Use the catalog in your integrations page">
            You can either import a single connector card or a catalog of all connectors that you select in the UI dashboard configuration (see [here](/recipes/embed-catalog) for more details).
            <Info>In order to fill the `linkedUserId` prop, use your own remote id that exist in your system **OR** check this [recipe](/recipes/import-existing-users) ! </Info>
            <CodeGroup>
                ```javascript Single Connector Card
                import "@panora/embedded-card-react/dist/index.css";
                import { PanoraProviderCard } from "@panora/embedded-card-react";
                import { ConnectorCategory } from '@panora/shared'

                <PanoraProviderCard
                    name={"hubspot"} // name of the provider
                    category={ConnectorCategory.Crm} // category where provider belongs to
                    projectId={"c9a1b1f8-466d-442d-a95e-11cdd00baf49"} // the project id tied to your organization
                    returnUrl={"https://acme.inc"} // the url you want to redirect users to after the connection flow is successful
                    linkedUserId={"b860d6c1-28f9-485c-86cd-fb09e60f10a2"}  // the linked id of the user if already created in Panora system or user's info in your system
                />
                ```
                ```javascript Whole Connector Catalog
                import "@panora/embedded-card-react/dist/index.css";
                import { PanoraDynamicCatalogCard } from "@panora/embedded-card-react";
                import { ConnectorCategory } from '@panora/shared'
                
                <PanoraDynamicCatalogCard
                    category={ConnectorCategory.Crm} // optional but if provided it returns only connectors of the category
                    projectId={"c9a1b1f8-466d-442d-a95e-11cdd00baf49"} // the project id tied to your organization
                    returnUrl={"https://acme.inc"} // the url you want to redirect users to after the connection flow is successful
                    linkedUserId={"b860d6c1-28f9-485c-86cd-fb09e60f10a2"}  // the linked id of the user if already created in Panora system or user's info in your system
                />
                ```
            </CodeGroup>
            You should see a card or catalog being rendered client-side !

            __insert photo__
        </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Step>
</Steps>

Once the user successfully completes the granting auth flow, the connection will have a `status` value of `valid`.

## **Step 2: Send your first unified API requests**

### _Create a contact in a CRM_

      <Check>
        We assume for this tutorial that you have a valid Panora API Key, and a
        `connection_token`. Find help [here](/core-concepts/auth).
      </Check>
      <Info>
        You can find the Typescript SDK on NPM
        [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panora/sdk)
      </Info>
      In this example, we will create a contact in a CRM. Visit other sections of the [documentation](/api-reference/introduction) to find category-specific examples.
      <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript TypeScript
        import { Panora } from "@panora/sdk";

        const panora = new Panora({
          apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
        });

        const input = {
            first_name: 'tom',
            last_name: 'jedusor',
            email_addresses: [
              {
                'email_address': 'tom@jedusor.com',
                'email_address_type': 'PERSONAL'
              }
            ],
            phone_numbers: [
              {
                'phone_number': '+33650438278',
                'phone_type': 'MOBILE'
              }
            ],
        };

        const result = await panora.crm.contacts.create({
          xConnectionToken: "YOUR_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN",
          unifiedCrmContactInput: input,
        });

        console.log(result);
        ```

        ```python Python
        import os
        from panora_sdk import Panora

        panora = Panora(
          api_key=os.getenv("API_KEY", ""),
        )

        body = {
          'first_name': 'tom',
          'last_name': 'jedusor',
          'email_addresses': [
            {
              'email_address': 'tom@jedusor.com',
              'email_address_type': 'PERSONAL'
            }
          ],
          'phone_numbers': [
            {
              'phone_number': '+33650438278',
              'phone_type': 'MOBILE'
            }
          ]
        }

        res = panora.crm.contacts.create(x_connection_token="YOUR_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN", unified_crm_contact_input=body)

        print(res)
        ```

        ```shell curl
        curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.panora.dev/crm/contacts \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
        --header 'x-connection-token: <MY_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN>' \
        --data '{
            "first_name": "tom",
            "last_name": "jedusor",
            "email_addresses": [
              {
                "email_address": "tom@jedusor.com",
                "email_address_type": "PERSONAL"
              }
            ],
            "phone_numbers": [
              {
                "phone_number": "+33650438278",
                "phone_type": "MOBILE"
              }
            ]
          }'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

Let’s break down what’s happening here:

- We import the `Panora` sdk, which provides a convenient way to interact with the Panora Unified API.
- We create an instance of the `Panora` client, passing in our API key.
- We call the `panora.crm.contacts.create` method to add a contact inside a 3rd party. We specify the input we want to use (see [here](/crm/contacts/overview) for reference).
- We pass the connection token catched during step 1 ([More info here](/core-concepts/auth#catch-connection-tokens))
- Finally, we print the response.

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you’ve successfully sent your first unified API request with Panora! Here are some next steps to continue your journey.
